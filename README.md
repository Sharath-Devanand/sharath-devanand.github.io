### Graduate Data Analyst seeking entry-level opportunities

## About me

Bonjour! I am Sharath Devanand from Chennai, India. I am an aspiring Data Analyst/Engineer/Scientist, well everything related to data. I got my bachelor's from the Indian Institute of Information Technology in Electronics Engineering and my master's from the University of Sheffield in Data Analytics. The quest for insights started when I landed my first internship at a startup company as a Data Analyst Intern where I uncovered numerous observations and patterns from the collected data for clients. I later went on to apply more of my skills in SQL and Python across projects in image processing and communication networks in my undergraduate program. These projects and internships landed my offer letter to the UK and here I am! Having been acing my courses with distinctions, I am excited to jump into the real world and solve some puzzles!

On a personal note, I grew up by the beach, have been playing the keyboard since I was 9, and a classically trained singer for 7 years and counting! I love solving jigsaw puzzles and can live off my mom's dosa for life. Also, I have taken a recent interest in all things fashion after coming to the UK (with more drastic climate changes compared to India, there are just so many ways to style clothes)
